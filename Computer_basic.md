# Computer Structure

Computer structure refers to the internal organization of a computer system and how its hardware components work together to perform tasks.

A computer system is mainly divided into four major components:

- Input Unit
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory Unit
- Output Unit

---

## 1. Input Unit

The Input Unit is responsible for receiving data and instructions from the user.

### Examples:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Scanner
- Microphone

The input unit converts data into binary form (0 and 1) so the computer can process it.

---

## 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the brain of the computer. It executes instructions and processes data.

The CPU consists of three main parts:

### a) Control Unit (CU)
- Controls all operations of the computer
- Directs the flow of data between memory and CPU
- Manages the Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle

### b) Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Performs logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, comparison)

### c) Registers
- Small and very fast memory inside the CPU
- Temporarily store data and instructions

---

## 3. Memory Unit

The Memory Unit stores data and instructions.

### Primary Memory
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
  - Temporary storage  
  - Volatile (data is lost when power is off)

- **ROM (Read Only Memory)**  
  - Permanent storage  
  - Non-volatile

### Secondary Storage
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
- Solid State Drive (SSD)
- USB Flash Drive

Used for long-term data storage.

---

## 4. Output Unit

The Output Unit displays processed results to the user.

### Examples:
- Monitor
- Printer
- Speakers

---

## Basic Working Process

Input → Memory → CPU → Output

This continuous process is known as the **Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle**.

## Summary

Computer structure includes:

- Input devices
- CPU (CU, ALU, Registers)
- Memory (Primary and Secondary)
- Output devices

Understanding computer structure helps in learning:
- Low-level programming
- Assembly language
- Operating systems
- Computer architecture
